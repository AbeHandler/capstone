### September 29, 2022

### Example project
Finding real qualitative researchers to get feedback will take time. I suggest bootstrapping or prototyping our software and workflow with CU Boulder students. We can conduct interviews try to analyze them with our software, then pair it with `r/CUBoulder`.

Interview questions on two topics which I think are on `r/CUBoulder`. We will need to all stick to the same rough script, but ask open-ended followups. This is called a `semi-structured` interview because you start with a script and allowed to deviate. I think we should try two topics.

###### Stress
- What are major causes of stress in your life?
- How do you manage stress?
- Have you ever sought out help for stress? And if so what did you do?

###### What people like/dislike about CU
- What do you like about CU Boulder?
- What do you dislike about it?
- If you had to go to college all over again, would you have chosen CU Boulder?

### Requirements
- [requirements.md](https://github.com/AbeHandler/capstone/blob/main/docs/notes/root.requirements.md)

### Misc

- I use Dendron for docs btw and am a fan of the tool.

#### Notes from meeting
We discussed just rebuilding the project instead of using Taguette. The stuff we get from Taguette is: code to ingest documents, upload documents, tag spans from documents with tags, organize and analze tags, export the tagged text

###### Links
- [Nvivo](https://www.qsrinternational.com/nvivo-qualitative-data-analysis-software/home) qualitative data analysis software
- [Dissertation](https://www.abehandler.com/assets/pdf/dissertation.pdf) See page 198 for relevant discussion

###### Abe
- List requirements for software, and make some mockups
- Pen and paper prototype to start


###### Jaryd and Bell:
-  Try to build a simple front end for tagging documents

###### Emily + Noah:
- Investigate scraping LinkedIn

###### Dane + Isabelle:
- Containerizing DJâ€™s code
- Abe will connect them with DJ


###### Notes leading up to meeting
- Abe reviewed the groups goals.
    - Did someone merge the PR? Seemed to work OK w/ a pull of main :)
    - If you had trouble, please ask a peer for help! This is a class!

Next steps:
- Take DJ's NLP code put it into Docker
    - Abe can point you to code
- Everyone can get software to build locally
- Port GitLab repo to GitHub
- Fix bugs?
- Learn how to scrape LinkedIn


Meeting Questions (from Jaryd):

- I understand the general concept is to connect a piece of software for annotating text to be able to search social media posts, but I have some clarifying questions:
    - What kind of service are we creating? Something that runs locally? Something that runs in the cloud and is just a web service people access? You mentioned docker, but I'm confused on the overall plan, I apologize if I missed that somewhere.
    - What's the overall point of linking text from annotated to social media posts? Some examples could be very helpful in understanding the project.
    - Where is the NLP code vs what we want to create.
    - Taguette will not run on Ventura without "hacks".
    - Ability to go above and beyond.


### September 15, 2022

- Introductions
- Goals for project
- Admin set up. Get everyone on the git repo.
- Meeting times? We may be able to split up.

##### Stuff for next time
- Make a folder for yourself on the git repo.
- Add a mark down file specifying your goals for the capstone. Please take an hour to think about this this week.
    - What do you actually want to get out of this?
    - How can I help you get there?

- Admin: we will try to use Github to keep track of our work this semester.
