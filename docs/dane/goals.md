# What do you actually want to get out of this?

I am hoping to learn something new in an area that I don't yet feel fully knowledgeable. The most obvious area for this would be NLP or AI, but there are plenty of possibilities for new things I could learn. I also hope to gain some experience working with a strong team, setting and achieving obtainable goals, and determining requirements with a customer. I also liked the aforementioned focus on user-centered design. This is something that I have not yet learned or explored in my career.

# How can I help you get there?

Good communication in the meetings is probably all I need. So far, the communication overall has been great, so I have no concerns with the direction of this project or the amount of extra help I'll need. Our initial ideas about the project from the first meeting aligned really well with what I want.
