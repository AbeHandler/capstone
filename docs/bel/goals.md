1. What do you actually want to get out of this?
- I would like to get more experience in working with a team in a more professional environment. Collaboration in most classes involves smaller groups without a need for defined roles, and I'm hoping that a project like this will be more accurate to the workplace. Learning how to design software to be user-friendly, as well as testing it, is also something I'm interested in. Overall, I want to make a noticeable contribution to a larger project.

2. How can I help you get there?
- Providing the team with clear goals is the most important part. Communicating regularly and providing feedback will also help all of us to work on the project effectively.
