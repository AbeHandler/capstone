# Jaryd's Goals

## What do you actually want to get out of this?

- An impressive project that people will actually *want* to use, and is good enough to get use in the future. (Something I'm proud to put on a resum√®)

- More experience with automated testing and coverage testing.


## How can I help you get there?

- Providing clear goals and expectations.

- Setting clear milestones.

- Helping make sure that we finish early enough that we have time to start adding additional cool features.
