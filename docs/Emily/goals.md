# Emily's Goals

## What do you actually want to get out of this?

My main goal in this project is to get experience of regulated group development on a long term scale. This involves the collaboration, with proper division of work, communication, and even things like version control in a constantly developing project. I have had experience with these things on a shorter time scale, however any longer projects I have done have been independent work, or with very limited collaboration. Beyond this, I wish to gain some natural language processing knowledge, as I have some focus in AI and Machine Learning in my coming career and education. Also, gaining some more in depth experience in modifying open source software, and further refining my software devlopment skills. In the end, I want to have a project that I'm proud of.

## How can I help you get there?

Providing the needed requirements and guidance on the logistical side would be helpful in having an overall good collaboration and group project work. In addition, the expertise you have on NLP would be a great resource for me to expand my own learning on the subject.
