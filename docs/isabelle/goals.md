### What do you actually want to get out of this?

- Have the opportunity to experiment with and further develop front-end skills

- Iterate through rounds of user testing and adjust our project accordingly, instead of a single round of user testing like in classes

- As I have no experience with NLP, I figured one of the best ways to start was just to gain exposure by working on something where I needed to know how it worked, but not necessarily code the algorithm itself. 

### How can I help you get there?

- With constructive feedback and consistent communication throughout the project, I'm sure this project will provide me with a fulfilling and explorative opportunity to do something cool :)
